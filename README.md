## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the **x86-multitasking-kernel**, a simple and efficient multitasking operating system kernel designed for the x86 architecture. This kernel brings multitasking capabilities to your computer, allowing you to run multiple processes simultaneously. Let‚Äôs walk through the steps to get you set up.

## üìã System Requirements

Before you start, ensure your computer meets these basic requirements:

- **Processor:** Intel or AMD x86 compatible processor.
- **RAM:** Minimum 512 MB of RAM.
- **Storage:** At least 100 MB of free disk space.
- **Virtual Machine:** QEMU installed (recommended for ease of use).

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is cosmOS?

cosmOS is a 32-bit multitasking operating system kernel created from scratch. It features a custom bootloader, an efficient process scheduler, and a FAT16 filesystem. Built using **C** and **Assembly**, this kernel allows you to explore the workings of an operating system without needing advanced programming skills.
